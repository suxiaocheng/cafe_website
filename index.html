	<h2>This weekendâ€™s special brunch</h2>
		<p> This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with scrambled egg
		on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is
		that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than
		four eggs in the pan at a time. </p>
